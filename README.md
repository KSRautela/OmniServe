# OmniServe

## Overview

OmniServe is a Wi-Fi-controlled omni-directional robotic platform designed for enhanced mobility and object manipulation in constrained environments. It features precise movement using encoder feedback, a 3-DOF robotic arm for pick-and-place operations, and a web-based dashboard for real-time control, system monitoring, PID tuning, and vector-based motion commands. The robot can move in all eight directions and rotate in place, making it ideal for agile navigation. Using a PID algorithm, it achieves accurate linear movements with control over distance and direction. OmniServe is suitable for applications such as warehouse automation, smart delivery systems, and educational robotics.

This project was developed as part of a summer internship at AICTE IDEA Lab, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, from June 23, 2024, to August 1, 2024.

## Features

- **Omni-Directional Movement**: 360-degree movement in any direction, including rotation in place, enabled by omni-wheels.
- **Encoder Feedback**: Real-time position and speed monitoring using quadrature encoders for precise control.
- **PID Control**: Ensures accurate distance and direction travel, with tunable parameters via the dashboard.
- **Web Dashboard**: Responsive interface for real-time control, telemetry display, and PID tuning. Supports joystick (using NippleJS) and keyboard (WASD) input.
